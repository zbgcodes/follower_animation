# Follower Animation
This is a simple Javascript app written using the Phaser framework to create a nice number counter animation with particle effects to celebrate follower milestones.

# To Do
- Iron out the code to resolve some particles not being displayed
- Create easily editable variables for foreground and background colours, follower count, particle count, particle style and font face
- Add output generators (GIF and MP4)

# Credits
- Phaser 2.6.2 created by PhotoStorm and hosted by CloudFlare
- Orbitron font downloaded from Google Fonts
